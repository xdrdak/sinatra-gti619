Sinatra Warden Template
=======================

As a developer sometimes I need to create small Web Applications that needs
authentication and others stuffs, but that makes me create them from
scratch, then I decided to create some little repos called SST (Sinatra Site
Template) where I can put the basis depending on what I need to create.

The goal is to create many repos with all the combinations needed to have a
start point and handling them with a gem (that is in creation process).



### Components
